# Euclidean Algorithm GCD Calculator

A web-based calculator that computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm. The application features an interactive interface with dark/light mode support and step-by-step calculation visualization.

## Features

- Calculate GCD of two positive integers
- Step-by-step visualization of the Euclidean Algorithm
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Responsive design
- Input validation
- Modern and clean user interface

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Google Fonts (Roboto)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elvisbrown-29/euclidean.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd euclidean-gcd-calculator
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser or use a local development server.

## Usage

1. Enter two positive integers in the input fields
2. Click the "Calculate GCD" button
3. View the step-by-step calculation process
4. See the final GCD result
5. Toggle between dark and light modes using the theme button

## How It Works

The Euclidean Algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers doesn't change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. The algorithm efficiently finds the GCD by repeatedly taking the remainder of the division of the two numbers until the remainder is zero.
